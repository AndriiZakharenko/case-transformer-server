# Case Transformer Server

## 🎮 About the Project
I created a simple server using Node.js that can transform text into different cases, such as uppercase, lowercase, and capitalized. This server allows users to send text data and receive the transformed output in the desired case format.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (For building the server and handling HTTP requests)

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **ESLint** – For maintaining consistent code quality  
- **Prettier** – For automatic code formatting  
- **Jest** – For testing the server functionality  

## 📌 Features
✅ Provides an endpoint to transform text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalized  
✅ Accepts text input via HTTP requests  
✅ Returns the transformed text in a structured response  

## 🌐 Demo
To run the app, clone the repository and run the server locally using Node.js. You can test the endpoints through HTTP requests (e.g., using Postman or curl).
